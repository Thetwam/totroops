        <p>We want to send out a limited set of packages <em>at cost</em> to test our end to end process. We'll be sending out invites soon with more details, but generally we want your feedback on our service. In exchange for an <em>at cost</em> care package, we'll be asking you to complete a few short surveys about your experience. We want ToTroops to be the absolute best possible way to send a care package and your early feedback will allow us to do it.</p>
